## What's New?

Yikes! Better late than never I guess. October has been a busy month so far and I've had a keen focus on practical agentic models and data systems theory. I'll also be preparing for presentations and events in November. Y'all take care!

As always, all of my work professionally and academically is kept as open-source as possible. To find my papers, blogs, classes, and other projects, check out my GitHub.
