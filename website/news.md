## What's New?

March is looking up! February was very busy: thanks to everyone that showed up to Data4. This month I have a Python Social at the Embarc Collective and a talk in Orlando to the ODevs group. I also have new projects coming up that are pretty exciting. Should be a great month ahead!

As always, all of my work professionally and academically is kept as open-source as possible. To find my papers, blogs, classes, and other projects, check out my GitHub.
