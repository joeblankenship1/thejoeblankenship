## What's New?

Quick update! Speaking at the [Data4 Conference](https://www.data4con.com/) this coming week: talking on top-level ontologies for knowledge governance. In March I'll be speaking in Orlando to ODevs on knowledge graphs and hosting a social for the Tampa Python Group. A lot going on: hope to see you out and about!
