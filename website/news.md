## What's New?

The end is nigh! I have no idea where 2025 went, but what a year. Many lessons learned from the school of hard knocks, but also a lot of good times and personal growth. I've had the chance to work and collaborate with some incredible people who allowed me to share their spaces and their thoughts: something for which I feel much wealthier than I did a year ago. Plenty of challenges going into 2026 and I'm looking forward to tackling them all! I hope y'all have a great rest of your 2025 and a great start to your 2026!

As always, all of my work professionally and academically is kept as open-source as possible. To find my papers, blogs, classes, and other projects, check out my GitHub.
