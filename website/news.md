# News - Latest and Greatest

Update by Joe Blankenship on February 6, 2025

## What's New?

New website! I needed to convert the old site into something I can use more easily and quickly in my busy schedule. Other than that, up to a lot of stuff this month: speaking and hosting the [Data4 Conference](https://www.data4con.com/), working on ontology design patterns, and several other projects.

As always, all of my work professionally and academically is kept as open-source as possible. To find my papers, blogs, classes, and other projects, check out my GitHub.
