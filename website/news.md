## What's New?

Behind on the update again! This month has been pretty fun: busy, but fun. Still focusing on agentic models for practical business uses while getting back into data architecture and data governance in the coming months. I'm also eager to be working some new colleagues, so a great chance to learn some new things from talented folks. The holidays are here, so everyone have fun and be safe!

As always, all of my work professionally and academically is kept as open-source as possible. To find my papers, blogs, classes, and other projects, check out my GitHub.
