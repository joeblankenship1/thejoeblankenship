## What's New?

August if off to a great start! Work is going very well, but has consumed all of my time (a trend that will continue throughout this month). As a result, it will mean that meetups and other side projects are going to take a backseat to my main work projects. Everyone have a great August and stay cool!

As always, all of my work professionally and academically is kept as open-source as possible. To find my papers, blogs, classes, and other projects, check out my GitHub.
