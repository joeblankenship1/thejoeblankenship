# About Me

## Geographer, Data Scientist, Hacker

I am a co-founder and the Chief Data Officer of Certus Core, a company specializing in AI governance and data engineering solutions. I am also the founder of CGRII, an all-volunteer organization which aims to explore and define cyberspace via geographic principles.

Most of my professional and academic education focuses on data science and data operations topics in the research, analytics, and information systems industries. I am skilled in machine learning, data analysis, geoinformatics, and data systems engineering using Python, GIS, and many other tools. I have a strong research and publication background focused on information systems, blockchain technologies, financial systems, political economy, and code/space.
