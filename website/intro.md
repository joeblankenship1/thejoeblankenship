```{admonition} AI Disclaimer

The text on this site is only written by myself. AI-generated images are used, but outside of spell check I try to make this website a clear reflection of my thoughts. As such, you will only read the most human of bad English grammar and most candid insights I've gleaned from my experiences in engineering, building, and life.
