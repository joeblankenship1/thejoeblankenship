# Research

## Overview

My current research focuses on the fundatmentals of good solutions engineering in an era of AI-enabled systems. This is part of my long-term research project: developing foundational knowledge and standards for the understanding and building of spaces created by people and technology. Beginning with human geography and GIS studies, I leverage several fields of research such as computer science and engineering, electronic engineering, mathematics, philosophy, logic, and sociology. A great amount of my initial research is inspired by works on the production of space, political economy, code/space, network society, actor network theory, and digital geography. I also look to the work currently being done in artificial intelligence, ontology, data sciences, data engineering, and data governance. I am indebted to the many researchers that have defined and forwarded these fields for us all.

## Data Solutions, AI, & Gamification

My current work is focused on taking complex, real-world challenges and building optimal solutions. My concentration is on:

* Applying data science, analytics, and operations to enable data-driven decisions
* Development of AI-enabled solutions for rapid exploration of information
* Use of gamification to incentivize the constructive and ethical use of engineered solutions

## Defining Cyberspace

I have engaged in reshaping the dialogue towards formalized cyber (or digital) geographic studies as part of my long-term professional and academic goals. My concentration is on:

* Consolidated nomenclature and concepts for cyber geography via digital geographic research
* Analysis of socio-technical differences in perception of cyberspace and cyberplace
* Development and implementation of open-source, internationally available frameworks and tools
* Promote and legitimize cyber geography as a unique field of study to schools around the world

## Signals Exploitation

Exploring and interacting with the electromagnetic spectrum that surrounds us has been a hobby of mine since I was a kid. I have developed educational materials to teach people about these concepts and ideas as a means to maintain, develop, and forward my knowledge. My concentration is on:

* Software Defined Radio
* Basic Radio Wave and Antenna Theory
* Manipulation of Radio and Non-radio Hardware using GNURadio
* Cellular Communications
* Mobile Platform and Systems Exploits
* Internet of Things, NFC, and Discrete Logic Systems
* Robotics
