# Research

## Overview

My current research focuses on knowledge engineering and data operations for enterprise systems. This is part of my long-term research project: developing foundational knowledge and standards for the understanding and building of spaces created by people and technology. Beginning with human geography and GIS studies, I leverage several fields of research such as computer science and engineering, electronic engineering, mathematics, philosophy, logic, and sociology. A great amount of my initial research is inspired by works on the production of space, political economy, code/space, network society, actor network theory, and digital geography. I also look to the work currently being done in artificial intelligence, ontology, data sciences, data engineering, and AI governance. I am indebted to the many researchers that have defined and forwarded these fields for us all.

## Knowledge Engineering & Data Operations

A significant portion of my current work is focused on the the building of data systems that leverage modeled schemata and information context for the construction of domain knowledge graphs and decision systems. My concentration is on:

* Knowledge representation of disparate data collections
* Automated reasoning systems for decision making
* Knowledge transfer systems for training and education
* Metadata standards for data management and governance

## Defining Cyberspace

I have engaged in reshaping the dialogue towards formalized cyber (or digital) geographic studies as part of my long-term professional and academic goals. My concentration is on:

* Consolidated nomenclature and concepts for cyber geography via digital geographic research
* Analysis of socio-technical differences in perception of cyberspace and cyberplace
* Development and implementation of open-source, internationally available frameworks and tools
* Promote and legitimize cyber geography as a unique field of study to schools around the world

## Signals Exploitation

Exploring and interacting with the electromagnetic spectrum that surrounds us has been a hobby of mine since I was a kid. I have developed educational materials to teach people about these concepts and ideas as a means to maintain, develop, and forward my knowledge. My concentration is on:

* Software Defined Radio
* Basic Radio Wave and Antenna Theory
* Manipulation of Radio and Non-radio Hardware using GNURadio
* Cellular Communications
* Mobile Platform and Systems Exploits
* Internet of Things, NFC, and Discrete Logic Systems
* Robotics
