# Blogs

Here is a collection of my writings over the years, largely drawn from my academic and independent research efforts. I wish I could say there is a theme here, but my work covers a range of qualitative and quantitative research depending on what I was working on and who I was working for at the time. Regardless, they are a reflection of where I was at a moment in time which is pretty cool: I can see where I was wrong, where I needed more work, and when I actually had a good point. Perhaps my attempts at contributing to the world's collective knowledge will inspire you to do the same.
