# The Bitcoin Labor Economy

## Global Footprint and Issues of Access

**Posted by Joe Blankenship on March 28, 2018**

I recently completed a short data journalism piece on Bitcoin and the spatial aspects of accessibility to that cryptocurrency network (using known mining node locations). I then compared this to known (yet artistically altered) locations
of information and communication infrastructure which facilitate high-speed Internet.

I used D3.js and Scrollama for the initial concept section of the article. I then used Leaflet for the more detailed interactive map. I used Python with Jupyter Lab to parse and prepare my data.

Check out the final product [here](https://github.com/joeblankenship1/bitcoin_labor/ "https://github.com/joeblankenship1/bitcoin_labor") (source code for the project can be found on my GitHub)!
